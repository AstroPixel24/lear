Enter Cornwall, Regan, Goneril, Edmund, the Bastard,
and Servants.

CORNWALL, to Goneril  Post speedily to my lord your
husband. Show him this letter. He gives her a
paper.  The army of France is landed.—Seek out
the traitor Gloucester.Some Servants exit.
REGAN  Hang him instantly.
GONERIL  Pluck out his eyes.
CORNWALL  Leave him to my displeasure.—Edmund,
keep you our sister company. The revenges we are
bound to take upon your traitorous father are not
fit for your beholding. Advise the Duke, where you
are going, to a most festinate preparation; we are
bound to the like. Our posts shall be swift and
intelligent betwixt us.—Farewell, dear sister.—
Farewell, my lord of Gloucester.

Enter Oswald, the Steward.

How now? Where’s the King?
OSWALD 
My lord of Gloucester hath conveyed him hence.
Some five- or six-and-thirty of his knights,
Hot questrists after him, met him at gate,
Who, with some other of the lord’s dependents,
Are gone with him toward Dover, where they boast
To have well-armèd friends.
CORNWALL  Get horses for your mistress.
Oswald exits.
GONERIL  Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
CORNWALL 
Edmund, farewell.Goneril and Edmund exit.
Go seek the traitor Gloucester.
Pinion him like a thief; bring him before us.
Some Servants exit.
Though well we may not pass upon his life
Without the form of justice, yet our power
Shall do a court’sy to our wrath, which men
May blame but not control.

Enter Gloucester and Servants.

Who’s there? The
traitor?
REGAN  Ingrateful fox! ’Tis he.
CORNWALL  Bind fast his corky arms.
GLOUCESTER 
What means your Graces? Good my friends,
consider
You are my guests; do me no foul play, friends.
CORNWALL 
Bind him, I say.
REGAN  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
GLOUCESTER 
Unmerciful lady as you are, I’m none.
CORNWALL 
To this chair bind him.Servants bind Gloucester.
Villain, thou shalt find—
Regan plucks Gloucester’s beard.
GLOUCESTER 
By the kind gods, ’tis most ignobly done
To pluck me by the beard.
REGAN 
So white, and such a traitor?
GLOUCESTER  Naughty lady,
These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin
Will quicken and accuse thee. I am your host;
With robber’s hands my hospitable favors
You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
CORNWALL 
Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
REGAN 
Be simple-answered, for we know the truth.
CORNWALL 
And what confederacy have you with the traitors
Late footed in the kingdom?
REGAN  To whose hands
You have sent the lunatic king. Speak.
GLOUCESTER 
I have a letter guessingly set down
Which came from one that’s of a neutral heart,
And not from one opposed.
CORNWALL  Cunning.
REGAN  And false.
CORNWALL  Where hast thou sent the King?
GLOUCESTER  To Dover.
REGAN 
Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at
peril—
CORNWALL 
Wherefore to Dover? Let him answer that.
GLOUCESTER 
I am tied to th’ stake, and I must stand the course.
REGAN  Wherefore to Dover?
GLOUCESTER 
Because I would not see thy cruel nails
Pluck out his poor old eyes, nor thy fierce sister
In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
In hell-black night endured, would have buoyed up
And quenched the stellèd fires;
Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
If wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time,
Thou shouldst have said “Good porter, turn the
key.”
All cruels else subscribe. But I shall see
The wingèd vengeance overtake such children.
CORNWALL 
See ’t shalt thou never.—Fellows, hold the chair.—
Upon these eyes of thine I’ll set my foot.
GLOUCESTER 
He that will think to live till he be old,
Give me some help!
As Servants hold the chair, Cornwall forces out
one of Gloucester’s eyes.
O cruel! O you gods!
REGAN 
One side will mock another. Th’ other too.
CORNWALL 
If you see vengeance—
FIRST SERVANT  Hold your hand,
my lord.
I have served you ever since I was a child,
But better service have I never done you
Than now to bid you hold.
REGAN  How now, you dog?
FIRST SERVANT 
If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
I’d shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
CORNWALL  My villain?Draw and fight.
FIRST SERVANT 
Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
REGAN, to an Attendant 
Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?
She takes a sword and runs
at him behind; kills him.
FIRST SERVANT 
O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
To see some mischief on him. O!He dies.
CORNWALL 
Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
Forcing out Gloucester’s other eye.
Where is thy luster now?
GLOUCESTER 
All dark and comfortless! Where’s my son
Edmund?—
Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature
To quit this horrid act.
REGAN  Out, treacherous villain!
Thou call’st on him that hates thee. It was he
That made the overture of thy treasons to us,
Who is too good to pity thee.
GLOUCESTER 
O my follies! Then Edgar was abused.
Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him.
REGAN 
Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
His way to Dover.
Some Servants exit with Gloucester.
How is ’t, my lord? How look you?
CORNWALL 
I have received a hurt. Follow me, lady.—
Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave
Upon the dunghill.—Regan, I bleed apace.
Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.
Cornwall and Regan exit.
SECOND SERVANT 
I’ll never care what wickedness I do
If this man come to good.
THIRD SERVANT  If she live long
And in the end meet the old course of death,
Women will all turn monsters.
SECOND SERVANT 
Let’s follow the old earl and get the Bedlam
To lead him where he would. His roguish madness
Allows itself to anything.
THIRD SERVANT 
Go thou. I’ll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!
They exit.
